# NeuralNetworkTutorial
The code for the tutorials on neural network basics. 
This code is written in Python 3, and requires the NumPy package installed. To run it, download it, and just run it in your preferred IDE.
To train the network on a larger dataset than just 10 numbers, change the variable 'training_set_neurons = 10' to a smaller or larger number.
The larger the dataset is, the longer the training time.
